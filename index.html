        <main>
            <p>Thank you for using "Discount Calculator" (hereinafter referred to as "the App"). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information. Our fundamental principle is: <strong>All possible data is stored locally on your device.</strong></p>

            <h2>1. Information We Process (Core Principle)</h2>
            <p>The core functionality of this App (calculating discounts) does not require or collect any personally identifiable information (such as your name, email, or phone number). To enhance your experience, the App only saves the following two settings locally on your device using the Hive database:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Theme Preference:</strong> Dark or Light mode.</li>
                <li><strong>Language Preference.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>These settings are stored solely to restore your preferences between App sessions. This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to us or any third party.</p>

            <h2>2. Third-Party Advertising (Google AdMob)</h2>
            <p>To support the free operation of this App, we use Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect and use data according to Google's own Privacy Policy to show personalized or non-personalized ads.</p>
            <p><strong>Data Collected by AdMob:</strong> This may include your device's advertising identifier, coarse location, and interaction data with ads.</p>
            <div class="note-box">
                <strong>Important:</strong> We have no control over the data collected by AdMob. This processing is conducted independently by Google. You can learn more about how Google uses data and manage your ad preferences via:<br><br>
                <strong>Google Privacy Policy:</strong> <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a><br><br>
                You can reset your advertising identifier or opt out of personalized ads in your device settings (e.g., on Android: Settings > Google > Ads).
            </div>

            <h2>3. Log Data</h2>
            <p>In relation to the AdMob service, anonymous ad performance data (like impressions and clicks) may be collected for analytics. Additionally, Google may automatically collect limited diagnostic data (such as crash logs) to maintain the stability of their service. Beyond what is collected by these integrated third-party services, we do not actively collect any diagnostic or usage logs ourselves.</p>

            <h2>4. Cookies & Similar Technologies</h2>
            <p>The App itself does not use browser cookies. However, AdMob uses the device's advertising ID for ad delivery. The local Hive storage used by our App is strictly for functional settings and cannot track you across other apps or websites.</p>

            <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> Your preference settings are stored locally. Their security depends on your device's own security measures. We recommend using standard device protection (like a screen lock).</li>
                <li><strong>Advertising Data:</strong> Security for data processed by AdMob is governed by Google's policies.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local Data (Theme/Language):</strong> Retained on your device until you uninstall the App or clear its data.</li>
                <li><strong>AdMob Data:</strong> Retention periods are determined by Google, as outlined in their privacy policy.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7. Links to Other Sites</h2>
            <p>The App may contain links to external websites (e.g., developer's site). These sites operate independently. We are not responsible for their content or privacy practices. Please review their policies before providing any information.</p>

            <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>This App is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. Furthermore, AdMob may have policies that limit personalized advertising for users under a certain age.</p>

            <h2>9. Your Rights (For EU and Other Regions)</h2>
            <p>Given that we do not collect personal data on our servers, your primary control is over your device:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can manage or reset your advertising identifier in your device settings.</li>
                <li>You can uninstall the App to remove all locally stored preferences.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For questions regarding data collected by AdMob, please refer to Google's policies.</p>

            <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this policy. The updated version will be posted here with a revised "Effective Date." For significant changes, we will notify you via the App's update notes. Please review this page periodically.</p>
