Discount Calculator: Smart Shopping Privacy Policy
Effective Date: february 1, 2026

Thank you for using "Discount Calculator: Smart Shopping" (hereinafter referred to as "the App"). We understand the importance of privacy and are committed to protecting your information transparently. The core design principle of this App is: All possible data is prioritized to be stored locally on your device.

1. How We Handle Your Information (Core Principle)
The core functionality of this App (calculating discounts) does not require nor collect any personally identifiable information (such as name, email address, device ID, etc.). To enhance your user experience, this App only saves the following two settings locally on your device:

Theme Preference: Dark or Light Mode.
Language Preference.
These settings are stored via a local database (Hive) and are used solely to restore your preferences each time you open the App. They are never sent to us or any external server.

2. Third-Party Advertising Services
To support the free operation of this App, we have integrated the Google AdMob advertising service. AdMob collects and uses data in accordance with its own privacy policy to display personalized or non-personalized ads to you. This data may include device identifiers, approximate location information, and advertising interaction data.

Important Note: We have no control over the data collected by AdMob. This data collection and processing activity is conducted independently by Google. We encourage you to read Google's privacy policy for details: https://policies.google.com/privacy.

3. Log Data
Related to the AdMob service, anonymous advertising log data (such as ad impressions and clicks) may be generated and collected for ad delivery and analytical purposes. Beyond this, the App currently does not actively collect any diagnostic or usage logs.

4. Cookies & Similar Technologies
The App itself does not use traditional web browser cookies. However, as mentioned above, AdMob may use advertising IDs or similar technologies for ad delivery. The local storage (Hive) within the App is used only for the aforementioned functional settings and does not have the ability to track you across apps or websites.

5. Data Security

Local Data: Your app preference settings are stored locally on the device. Their security is directly tied to the security of your device itself. We recommend you take common device security measures (such as setting a screen lock).

Advertising Data: For data processed by AdMob, its security practices are governed by Google's privacy and security policies.

6. Links to Other Sites
The App may contain links to third-party websites (such as the developer's website). Please note that these sites are not under our control, and their content and privacy practices are not associated with us. Please review the privacy policies of any third-party sites before accessing them.

7. Children's Privacy
This App is not designed for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect any information from such users. Regarding advertising, AdMob has its own policies concerning children.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated policy will be posted on this page, and the "Effective Date" will be revised accordingly. For significant changes, we will provide notice in the App's update notes. We advise you to review this page periodically for any changes.
