Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy explains how Discount Calculator: Smarter Shopping handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about data practices.

1. Information We Collect
Our app is designed to minimize data collection. We only collect the following information, which is stored locally on your device:

Language Preference: The language you select for the app interface (e.g., Chinese, English).

Theme Preference: Your choice of dark or light mode for the app appearance.

These preferences are collected solely to provide a consistent experience—for example, to remember your settings when you reopen the app.

2. How We Use Your Information
The collected information is used exclusively for:

Retaining your language selection for future sessions.

Maintaining your chosen theme mode.

We do not use this data for any other purpose, including analytics, advertising, or personalization beyond the app's core functionality.

3. Storage and Security
All data is stored locally on your device using Hive, a lightweight database. No information is transmitted over the internet or stored on external servers. Since the app operates offline, your data remains entirely under your control and is never accessed by us or third parties.

4. Data Sharing
We do not share, sell, or distribute any of your information. Your data stays on your device and is never sent to any server or third party.

5. User Rights and Control
You have full control over your data:

You can change your language or theme preferences anytime within the app settings.

If you uninstall the app, all locally stored data will be automatically deleted from your device.

6. Children's Privacy
Our app does not collect personal information from children. It is safe for users of all ages.

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Any changes will be reflected within the app, and your continued use signifies acceptance of the updated terms.
